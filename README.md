## 1 Project Overview
### App Overview and Context
A project allowing educators to create and store lessons for easy access. Lesson files 
(PowerPoint, worksheets etc.) can be uploaded to download on any internet-connected 
device at a later date. Lessons can be linked to UK National Curriculum statements to 
keep track of coverage across a school year.

This project aims to reduce the workload of teachers by offering an easy-to-use and 
intuitive UI, with an end-goal of integrating a UI lesson generator into the app. 
Options will be given for teachers to use research-based lesson structures (such as 
the <a href="https://d2tic4wvo1iusb.cloudfront.net/eef-guidance-reports/metacognition/Seven_step_model_1.0.pdf">
EEF 7-step model</a>) to improve the efficiency whilst planning.

The full scope of this app can be found in the [scope document](docs/scope.md).

### Tech Stack
The app will use a mixture of frameworks across the full stack. For the frontend, React
will be used along with Boostrap to structure the UI. The backend will be built using Laravel
 with MongoDB.

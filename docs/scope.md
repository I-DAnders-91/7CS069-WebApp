__create, manage, and organise lesson plans__. Each plan will allow the user to store 
key lesson details (such as subject, year group, objectives, and activities) as

handouts). The application is intended as a practical tool for primary school 
teachers and as an academic exercise in applying modern development approaches 
using frameworks.

* Deliver a __RESTful API__ with persistent data storage, validation, and error handling.
* Showcase effective use of __GitHub project management__ (issues, milestones, labels).
* Collect __testing and performance evidence__ to inform the reflective report.

## Out of Scope
* Multi-user authentication and permissions (stretch feature if time allows).
* Advanced search/tagging across lessons.
* Curriculum objective mapping.
* Export to PDF or external file sharing.

## Deliverables
* A fully functional web application (React frontend, Laravel backend, database).
* Complete GitHub repository with documented commits, project board, and README.
* Evidence of automated testing and performance improvements.
* Screenshots and loags for inclusion in the reflective report.

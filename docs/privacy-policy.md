# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 28th September 2025

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how this application (“the App”) collects, uses, and safeguards information provided by users. The App has been developed solely for academic purposes as part of a university module. It is not a publicly released product and is not intended for commercial use.

## 2. Information Collected
- The App may process limited data entered by users (e.g., lesson details, file attachments) to demonstrate application functionality.  
- The App does not require or intentionally collect personally identifiable information (such as names, addresses, or contact details).  
- No tracking technologies, cookies, or analytics tools are implemented.  

## 3. Purpose of Processing
Data entered into the App is used exclusively to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and related features. Information is not shared with third parties, sold, or used for any purpose beyond demonstration.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
- Data is stored only within the local application environment used for the demonstration.  
- No external servers, cloud services, or third-party storage systems are employed.  
- Basic security measures have been applied to ensure that demonstration data is not accessible outside of the testing environment.  

## 5. Data Retention
All user-entered data is temporary and may be deleted when the App is reset, closed, or redeployed. No permanent records are maintained.

## 6. User Rights
As the App is an academic prototype and does not process personal data in a live environment, formal data protection rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure) are not applicable.

## 7. Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate with external third-party services, APIs, or platforms.

## 8. Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be amended during the course of development to reflect adjustments in functionality. Users will be informed of material changes if applicable.
